      <p>At the Institute for Software we have been developing plug-ins for Eclipse CDT for almost a decade. Some of this work has been contributed back to Eclipse (e.g. the majority of refactorings and the underlying infrastructure for writing refactorings), others like <a href="http://linticator.com">Linticator</a> are available commercially, but the majority is open source (e.g. <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/metriculator">Metriculator</a>) or even free. This is where CUTE comes in.</p>

      <p>CUTE is an easy to use <span style="color:red;">C++</span> unit testing framework that leverages modern <span style="color:red;">C++</span> libraries and features. CUTE is orthogonal, easily extendable and much simpler than other <span style="color:red;">C++</span> unit testing approaches like CPPUnit. For example, CUTE does not require that you write a derived class for each <span style="color:red;">C++</span> class you want to unit test.</p>
      
      <h1>Eclipse Plug-in for C++ Unit Testing with CUTE</h1>

      <p>Automated unit testing supports high quality of program code, even under inevitable change and refactoring. As a side effect, unit tested code often has a better structure. Java developers are used to unit testing because of JUnit and its tight integration into IDEs like Eclipse. <span style="color:red;">C++</span> programmers lacked the tool support for easy-to-use unit testing, even though the language's complexity asks for it.</p>

      <p>Refactoring and simplifying <span style="color:red;">C++</span> code without tests is very hard. No longer!</p>

      <p>IFS created a simple to use <span style="color:red;">C++</span> unit testing framework - CUTE (<span style="color:red;">C++</span> Unit Testing Easier) - and integrated it into Eclipse CDT similar to JUnit.</p>

      <ul>
  	  	<li>Wizards creating test frames</li>
  		  <li>Test navigator with green/red bar</li>
  		  <li>Diff-viewer for failing tests</li>
  		  <li>Gcov coverage visualization</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Mock Support</h1>

      <p>The CUTE plug-in does not provide mock support by itself. But, thanks to an ambitious student project by Michael RÃ¼egg, a powerful additional mock support plug-in is available. See the <a href="http://www.mockator.com/">Mockator Page</a> for more information.</p>
