We are very excited to introduce the new **CUTE** website with a brand new look and feel.

At the [Institute for Software](http://ifs.hsr.ch) we have developed numerous plug-ins for Eclipse, for example the popular CUTE unit testing framework. This new and improved website provides all the information you as a developer might need.

Our goal is to make it easier and more pleasurable to write modern <span style="color:red;">C++</span> code!

Get more information about the [team behind CUTE](/about) and the [features it contains](/features). Or just [install](/installation) CUTE and see for yourself. You should also [follow us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/cevelop), and [let us know](/contact) what you think.
