---

Today, we released CUTE 5.6.1. This release updates the underlying Eclipse Platform to 2018-12 
and the underlying CDT version to 9.6.1. Additionally, the following bugs have been fixed:

* Several quick-fixes have been missing in the last release
* Sometimes the "Test Results" view didn't show any output
* There was a timing issue in the "Test Results" view
* GCOV integration was broken
* Some of the Mockator examples were broken

<br/>

As always, you can download CUTE from the Eclipse Marketplace (go to the [Installation page](/installation) for instructions).
If you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/contact).
